I am a fifth year PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University, and I have developed computational tools and approaches to interpret rare disease causing variants during for my doctoral research. I am skilled in computational structural biology, genomics, machine learning and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. I have had the opportunity for my research to directly benefit individuals suffering from undiagnosed diseases. I am motivated to keep developing machine learning tools to facilitate disease diagnosis and uncover disease mechanisms. I am enthused about working in industry to help develop improved precise, personalized healthcare technology and pharmaceutical intervention strategies. I have successfully led multiple interdisciplinary and collaborative projects to completion, and extensively liasoned with clinicians and wet-lab scientists. I have contributed to over 7 manuscripts as lead and supporting author. I have demonstrated my communication skills presented my research, both orally and as posters, intramurally and at multiple International conferences. I have always enjoyed working as a team and have performed theater profusely in school and college. I have served as a part of multiple student organizations over the past five years at Vanderbilt to contribute to the community and further develop my leadership and teamwork skills.
